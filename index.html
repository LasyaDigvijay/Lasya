          Formerly a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, Panic! At The Disco is now the solo project of American singer, 
          songwriter and musician, Brendon Urie (see right).
          Panic! is known for their crazy music videos and experimentations in music genre, although they are largely described as alternative rock.
          Besides studio albums, Panic! has also produced soundtracks for movies such as Jennifer's Body, Suicide Squad, and Frozen 2.
          </p>
          <p>
          Apart from his work as Panic!, Brendon has collaborated extensively with labelmate Fall Out Boy, lending his vocals to quite a few 
          of their tracks.
He also collaborated with Taylor Swift for her track, Me!, which reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

          In June 2018, Urie launched the High Hopes Foundation to support other non-profit organisations that advocate for human rights.

        <h3>
            Formation of the Band
        </h3>
        <p>
            Panic! was formed in 2004 by childhood friends Brendon Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson.
            Initially starting out as a Blink-182 cover band, they recorded their first original demos while still in high school. 
            Upon receiving these demos, Fall Out Boy's bassist, Pete Wentz, was highly impressed and immediately asked to sign them to his label,
            Decaydance Records.
            In 2006, it was announced that original bassist, Brent Wilson, was removed from the band due to his lack of responsibility, and was replaced
            by Jon Walker.

            First Lineup Change
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 2009, post the release of the band's second studio album, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker were revealed to be quitting the band due 
            to creative differences.
            The two were inspired to continue working on the retro-inspired sound of the previous album, while Urie wanted to explore a more
            polished pop sound.

        <h3>
            Second Lineup Change
        </h3>
        <p> 
            In 2010, Dallon Weekes, a previously touring member (bassist), was inducted as a full-time member.
            In 2013, prior to the recording of the band's third studio album, Spencer Smith unofficially left the band due to 
            health and drug-related issues. In 2015, it was announced that he would be officially leaving the band.
            Soon after, Weekes returned to being just a touring member of the band, leaving Urie as the sole remaining member,
            with a solo project.
